# Refactor-HW

## Description 

For this assignment I was tasked by a marketing agency to help their websites "accessibility". Having been given already written code it was up to me to observe the "scout rule" and clean up the out-dated html that was within the file. I changed the out-dated divs with more semantic friendly selectors. I also helped consolidate the css and helped eliminate some of the redundancy. I left comments in the style.css file for where i made changes and the justificiation for some of my changes. 




## Installation

I honestly dont know. Download from github is my best guess.

## Usage 

It's a website to help bring business to HORISEON. 


## Credits

Id like to thank Brian Swarthout and Wilson Lam for providing the base code and teaching me so far. 



## License
